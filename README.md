# Logistic Regression Classifier Using Stochastic Gradient Ascent

This project focuses on buildling a logistic regression classifier of product reviews. It uses Stochastic Gradient Ascent for achieving the optimization objective.Here, we calculate the coefficient(the role of) of each word in a review and then base a classifier out of it.
(This mini-project is a part of ML specialization course, dataset or any pre-trained weights/models used were provided by Coursera.)
